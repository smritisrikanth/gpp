DESIGN:
The game starts with main creating a new game:
    Game has a copy constructor to help with the in_check functionality
    We created separate functions for path checking (path_clear) and legal move checks (is_legal_move)
    Those functions are called in the other game functions to help consolidate code
    in_mate calls in_stalemate and in_check to have less implementation

    point_value was implemented by using the Board iterator we created and then will add up all the point values assigned to a piece with the matching color as the current turn

    Board has a copy constructor to deep_copy the map
    It also has a custom iterator to be used for iterating over the board for Game

COMPLETENESS:
Everything in the code should work correctly from out perspective
some memory aspects might no be fully implemented
