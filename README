DESIGN:
The game starts with main creating a new game:
    Game has a copy constructor to help with the in_check and in_stalemate functionality

    We created separate functions for path checking (path_clear) and legal move checks (is_legal_move).
    Those functions are called in the other game functions to help consolidate code.
    in_mate calls in_stalemate and in_check to have less implementation

    We created an additional function that takes in a position and returns all the legal moves (with the exception of checking if the move exposes check) in order to iterate through possible moves in in_stalemate (possible_moves).

    point_value was implemented by using the Board iterator we created and then will add up all the point values assigned to a piece with the matching color as the current turn

    Board has a copy constructor to deep_copy the map
    It also has a custom iterator to be used for iterating over the board for Game

COMPLETENESS:
Everything in the code should work correctly from out perspective
some memory aspects might no be fully implemented
